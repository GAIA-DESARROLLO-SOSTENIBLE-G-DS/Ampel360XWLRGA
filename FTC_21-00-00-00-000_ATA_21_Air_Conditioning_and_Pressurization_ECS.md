## 21.140. Configuration Management

### **21.140.1 Overview**

Configuration Management (CM) ensures that the **Environmental Control System (ECS)** maintains its integrity and performance throughout its lifecycle. CM encompasses the systematic control of system configurations, documentation, and changes to prevent unauthorized alterations and ensure consistency across all ECS components and software.

### **21.140.2 Configuration Control**

#### **21.140.2.1 Change Identification**

- **Definition:**
  - Identifying and documenting proposed changes to the ECS, including hardware modifications, software updates, and procedural adjustments.

- **Process:**
  - Submit a Change Request (CR) detailing the nature, reason, and impact of the proposed change.
  - CRs can originate from design teams, maintenance personnel, or operational feedback.

#### **21.140.2.2 Change Evaluation**

- **Impact Analysis:**
  - Assess the potential effects of the proposed change on system performance, safety, compliance, and interoperability with other systems.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Evaluate the risks associated with implementing or not implementing the change, including potential failure modes and their consequences.

#### **21.140.2.3 Change Approval**

- **Review Board:**
  - Establish a Configuration Control Board (CCB) comprising representatives from Design, Maintenance, Operations, and Quality Assurance.

- **Approval Criteria:**
  - Changes must meet predefined criteria for safety, compliance, performance, and cost-effectiveness.

- **Documentation:**
  - Approved changes are documented in the Configuration Management Database (CMDB) with detailed descriptions and justifications.

### **21.140.3 Version Control**

#### **21.140.3.1 Version Identification**

- **Version Numbering:**
  - Assign unique version numbers to ECS components and software, following a standardized format (e.g., Major.Minor.Patch).

- **Baselines:**
  - Establish baselines for different stages of the ECS lifecycle (e.g., Design Baseline, Production Baseline, Maintenance Baseline).

#### **21.140.3.2 Tracking Changes**

- **CMDB Utilization:**
  - Maintain a centralized CMDB to track all versions, changes, and the current configuration of the ECS.

- **Audit Trails:**
  - Record all modifications, including who authorized the change, who implemented it, and when it occurred.

### **21.140.4 Documentation Management**

#### **21.140.4.1 Documentation Standards**

- **Consistency:**
  - Use standardized formats and nomenclature across all ECS documentation to ensure clarity and uniformity.

- **Accessibility:**
  - Ensure that all documentation is easily accessible to authorized personnel through secure digital repositories.

#### **21.140.4.2 Document Control**

- **Version Updates:**
  - Update relevant documents (e.g., schematics, user manuals, maintenance procedures) to reflect approved changes.

- **Review Cycles:**
  - Implement regular review cycles to verify the accuracy and relevance of documentation.

### **21.140.5 Approval Processes**

#### **21.140.5.1 Change Request Submission**

- **Procedure:**
  - Submit CRs using the standardized Change Request Form, providing comprehensive details about the proposed change.

- **Required Information:**
  - Description of the change, justification, affected components, impact analysis, and proposed implementation plan.

#### **21.140.5.2 Change Request Review**

- **Initial Screening:**
  - The CCB conducts an initial review to determine the necessity and feasibility of the change.

- **Detailed Evaluation:**
  - Perform an in-depth evaluation involving technical assessments, safety reviews, and compliance checks.

#### **21.140.5.3 Final Approval and Implementation**

- **Approval:**
  - Upon satisfactory evaluation, the CCB approves the change and authorizes its implementation.

- **Implementation:**
  - Execute the change according to the approved plan, ensuring adherence to all relevant procedures and standards.

- **Post-Implementation Review:**
  - Conduct a review to verify that the change has been implemented correctly and that it achieves the intended outcomes without introducing new issues.

### **21.140.6 Traceability**

#### **21.140.6.1 Requirements Traceability**

- **Linking Changes to Requirements:**
  - Ensure that all changes are traceable to specific system requirements or enhancements.

- **Traceability Matrix:**
  - Maintain a traceability matrix that maps changes to their corresponding requirements, design elements, and testing activities.
