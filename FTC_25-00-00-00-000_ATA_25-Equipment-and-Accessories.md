## **Next Steps**

1. **Illustrate Complex Topics**:  
   Diagrams/flowcharts for cargo restraint, cybersecurity workflows, AI-driven cabin management, etc.

2. **Validate Regulatory Sections**:  
   Cross-check FAR/CS updates, EASA bulletins, ICAO standards, ISO/SAE guidelines.

3. **Implementation Guidance**:  
   Provide annexes or white papers detailing retrofit strategies, advanced accessibility, AI system integration, and circular economy initiatives.

4. **Global Trends**:  
   Emphasize **biophilic design**, **green engineering solutions**, **modular cabin architectures**, and **sustainable supply chains** in [25.140 Future Trends and Innovations](#25140-future-trends-and-innovations).

By integrating these sections and references, **ATA 25** becomes **technically robust** and **forward-looking**, supporting the **GAIA AIR – Ampel360XWLRGA** Aircraft’s goal of delivering **sustainable**, **secure**, and **innovative** cabin solutions for modern aviation.
