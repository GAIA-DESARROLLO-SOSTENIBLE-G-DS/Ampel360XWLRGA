# **ATA 25 – Equipment & Furnishing**

This document outlines the **Equipment & Furnishing** requirements and standards for aircraft design and operation, focusing on **emergency equipment** and related **regulatory compliance**. It aligns with **EASA** and **FAA** regulations (e.g., **CS-25** for large aircraft) to ensure both **passenger safety** and **operational efficiency**.

---

## **1. Emergency Equipment**

### **1.1 Types of Equipment**
- **Fire Extinguishers (FireEx)**
- **Life Rafts**
- **Escape Slides**
- **First Aid Kits**

**Note**: The type and quantity of equipment depends on aircraft size (**A/C**) and the number of passengers (**Pax**). These items must be readily accessible, clearly marked, and maintained in accordance with manufacturer and regulatory guidelines.

---

### **1.2 Regulatory Requirements**
- **Certification Standards (CS)**:
  - **CS 23**: Standards for smaller (commuter) aircraft.
  - **CS 25**: Standards for large transport aircraft.
- **Influencing Factors**:
  - Aircraft size and configuration.
  - Passenger capacity and mission profile.

---

### **1.3 Emergency Equipment Specifications**
- **Location and Accessibility**:
  - Equipment must be stowed in approved compartments or racks.
  - Markings must be clear, with instructions for quick retrieval.
- **Quantity**:
  - Determined by the aircraft’s passenger capacity and regulatory directives.
- **Maintenance**:
  - Regular inspections and replacements (e.g., for expired fire extinguishers, damaged life vests, etc.).
  - Document all checks in the aircraft’s logbook or CMMS (Computerized Maintenance Management System).

---

## **2. Fire Extinguisher Requirements (CS 25.851)**

### **2.1 Minimum Requirements**
- **CS 25.851(a)(1)** specifies the number of portable fire extinguishers needed on board based on passenger load.
- They must be of a type suitable for aviation use (often Halon or approved alternatives).

---

### **2.2 Examples**
- **For an aircraft with 250 passengers**: **4** fire extinguishers are required.
- **Reference Table** for fire extinguishers:

| **Passenger Capacity** | **Number of Fire Extinguishers** |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 7–30                   | 1                                |
| 31–60                  | 2                                |
| 61–200                 | 3                                |
| 201–300                | 4                                |
| 301–400                | 5                                |
| 401–500                | 6                                |
| 501–600                | 7                                |
| 601–700                | 8                                |

---

## **3. Additional Requirements (CS 25)**

### **3.1 Emergency Features**
- **Emergency Doors**: Placement and operation must comply with exit requirements for the passenger configuration.
- **Seat Belts**: Must meet crashworthiness standards; some seats may require airbags.
- **Exit Signs**: Illuminated, with proper visibility under normal and emergency lighting.
- **Emergency Lighting**: Must meet the required level of illumination for evacuation routes.
- **Life Raft Locations**: Clearly labeled, easily accessible, and fitted with appropriate survival equipment.

---

### **3.2 EASA Certification Standards**
- Governed by **EASA** regulations for large transport aircraft, particularly focusing on:
  - **Fire Suppression**: Quick-release systems or extinguishers for specific compartments.
  - **Crashworthiness**: Ensuring emergency gear remains secured during impact.

---

## **Conclusion**
Equipping an aircraft according to **ATA 25 – Equipment & Furnishing** standards ensures both **regulatory compliance** and **passenger safety**. Proper **emergency equipment** (including adequate fire extinguishers, life rafts, and first aid kits) along with **robust design** (seat belts, exit signs, and lighting) is crucial for safe operations. Ongoing **maintenance** and **regular inspections** are imperative to keep equipment in ready-to-use condition. 

By adhering to **CS 25** and relevant airworthiness regulations, airlines and operators confirm they have the necessary firefighting, evacuation, and survival equipment for various flight scenarios. Future updates to **safety equipment** will continue to evolve as technology advances, regulatory bodies adapt standards, and industry best practices develop.

**Next Steps**: 
1. **Maintain up-to-date** references for equipment replacement intervals.  
2. **Implement training** programs for crew on emergency equipment handling.  
3. **Regularly review** EASA/FAA directives for potential changes in equipment or seat belt requirements.
