**Explanation:**

- **MaintenanceTransaction Class:**
  - **Initialization:** Captures all relevant maintenance data, including detected anomalies, predicted maintenance schedules, and technician information.
  - **Signing:** Uses PQCrypto to sign the transaction, ensuring data integrity and authenticity.
  - **Verification:** Validates the signature before recording the transaction on the blockchain.

- **HPC Cluster Integration:**
  - **run_ml_model:** Processes real-time flight data using machine learning models to detect anomalies.
  - **predictive_analytics:** Analyzes detected anomalies to predict maintenance needs and schedule tasks accordingly.

- **Blockchain Recording:**
  - **Immutable Logging:** Ensures that all maintenance transactions are securely and immutably recorded on the blockchain, facilitating traceability and compliance.

- **Additional Enhancements:**
  - **Logging:** Integrated logging for better monitoring and debugging.
  - **Error Handling:** Added try-except blocks to handle potential errors gracefully.
  - **Signature Validation Check:** Ensured that transactions with failed signatures are not added to the blockchain.
  - **Comments:** Included comments for clarity and understanding of each code section.
  - **Configuration Management:** Externalize configuration parameters for flexibility.
  - **Asynchronous Processing:** Implement asynchronous processing for improved performance.
  - **Scalability Considerations:** Designed the system to support horizontal scaling, allowing the addition of more HPC clusters or blockchain nodes as needed.
