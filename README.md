## Additional Recommendations

### A. Glossary File (`CPT_0_GLOSSARY.md`)

Ensure that all acronyms and technical terms used in the **CPT_000_Dependencies-matrix.md** and **README.md** files are comprehensively defined in the glossary.

**Example Entry:**

```markdown
# Glossary

## ATA

**ATA**: Air Transport Association - A standard classification system for aircraft systems and components.

## FADEC

**FADEC**: Full Authority Digital Engine Control - A system that manages all aspects of engine performance.

## SHM

**SHM**: Structural Health Monitoring - Systems that monitor the integrity and health of the aircraft's structure in real-time.

...
```

### B. Visual Dependency Diagrams

Incorporate visual diagrams to represent complex dependencies. Place these images in the `images/` directory and reference them within the relevant sections.

**Example Integration:**

```markdown
![Dependency Diagram](images/dependency_diagram.png)
```

**Best Practices:**

- Ensure images are clear and appropriately labeled.
- Reference images within the table or relevant sections for contextual support.

### C. Automation and Continuous Integration

Implement scripts and tools to automate the creation and maintenance of documentation.

**Python Example for Automated Table Generation:**

```python
import pandas as pd

def csv_to_markdown(csv_file, output_md):
    df = pd.read_csv(csv_file, delimiter=';')
    with open(output_md, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        f.write(df.to_markdown(index=False))
    print(f"Markdown table saved to {output_md}")

# Usage
csv_to_markdown('matriz_dependencias.csv', 'CPT_000_Dependencies-matrix.md')
```

**Benefits:**

- Reduces manual effort.
- Ensures consistency.
- Facilitates updates and maintenance.

### D. Version Control and Documentation Practices

- **Versioning:** Maintain version numbers and dates in your documentation to track changes over time.
- **Changelog:** Create a `CHANGELOG.md` file summarizing significant updates, enhancements, and fixes made to the documentation and project files.
- **Branching Strategy:** Utilize feature branches for major updates or new sections to facilitate organized development and review processes.

### E. Accessibility and Usability

- **Table of Contents:** Already included for easy navigation.
- **Search Functionality:** Ensure documentation is searchable via GitHub's built-in search or by implementing a search feature in your GitHub Pages site.
