**Detailed Task Cards with FTCode Tokens**
- Each task card references FTCode tokens, ensuring quick retrieval of related documentation (S1000D modules, part specs, procedure instructions).
- Automated Updating: Any revision to a task (e.g., torque specs) is hashed on the blockchain with its FTCode, preventing manual mislabeling or confusion.

**Integration with Blockchain**
- Immutable Recordkeeping: Completed tasks (e.g., filter replacements, software updates) are automatically logged.
- Components Lifecycle Management: Ties replaced components to their original manufacturer, operational hours, and inspection results.
- Regulatory Audit-Friendly: Transparent maintenance history satisfies EASA/FAA compliance.

**Flexible Scheduling**
- Dynamic Interval Adjustments: Condition-based data from sensors (e.g., wear levels, temperature cycles) can extend or shorten intervals for certain tasks.
- AI-Driven Updates: The system suggests revised schedules when new patterns or potential issues arise, ensuring tasks are performed neither too early nor too late.

### **Example Use Case**
**Task Card:** Landing Gear Strut Inspection  
**FTCode:** [REDACTED]

### **Condition Monitoring Workflow**
1. On-Board IoT Sensors gather continuous operational data.
2. ML Analysis matches patterns with known wear signatures or potential anomalies.
3. AGI interprets results, suggests time-to-service estimations, and calculates potential cost-saving or risk-lowering measures.
4. Maintenance Action is recommended, scheduled, and recorded (via FTCode + blockchain).

### **Benefits**
